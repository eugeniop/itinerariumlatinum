*Nouns* (et. *Nomen*: name) is the name we give to things, people, and places; either generally (the city, the man), or specifically (Seattle, Marcus).  

As described in the introduction, nouns in Latin, are grouped into "Declensions" which tell us how the words end. The ending of a word, signals the function the perform (called "cases").

As a review, there are 6 cases in Latin: 

* **Nominative**: commonly the **subject**
* **Genitive**: frequently used to copmnvey **possession** - translated with _of_
* **Dative**: translated with the prepositions _to_ and _for_. Marks the think or the person indirectly affected by the verb
* **Accusative**: signals the **direct object** of the verb.
* **Ablative**: comes in many forms, usually to signal **means**, **agent**, **manner**, **place** and **time**. Translated with _with_, _by_, _in_. Think of the ablative as a way of modifying the **verb** (e.g. _we travel by car_, _we pay with coins_)
* **Vocative**: (et. _vocare_: call) used to call someone or something (figuratively).

### First Declension Nouns

The vast majority of 1st Declension nouns are *FEMENINE*. Of course, there are a few exceptions with words that (to me) _look_ femenine but they are (traditionally for the Romans) masculine. Here are some examples: _poeta_, _nauta_, _agricola_, _pirata_. 

Nouns are declined by adding an _ending_ to a _base_. The way to identify the _base_ is by eliminating the _genitive_ ending. 

For example:

The genitive for _porta_ (meaning _gate_) is _portae_. Thus the _base_ is **port-**.

|Singular|Noun|Ending|
|--------|------|------|
|Nominative    |porta | -a   |
|Genitive     |portae| -ae  |
|Dative     |portae| -ae  |
|Accusative     |portam| -am  |
|Ablative     |portā | -ā   |
|Vocative     |porta  | -a  |

|Plural|Noun|Ending|
|--------|------|------|
|Nominative    |portae | -ae   |
|Genitive     |portarum| -arum  |
|Dative     |portīs| -īs  |
|Accusative     |portas| -as  |
|Ablative     |portīs | -īs   |
|Vocative     |portae  | -ae  |

If you know a noun is of the 1st declension, and you know the genitive (ending in **-ae**), then you know how to decline all cases.

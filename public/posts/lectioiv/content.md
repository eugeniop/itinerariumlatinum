If **Adjectives** modify **nouns**, guess what **adverbs** modify? If you thought **verbs**, you are right!

Adverbs provide more information on the action being performed. When we say _I ran quickly_, _quickly_ is telling us you were not slow. They can also modify **adjectives** (and other adverbs). For example, you can say: _I ran quickly in my beautifully flowered pants_

Adverbs don't change in Latin for case, gender, or number; because…there’s no **noun** they affect.

In Latin now:

| Part of speech | Does it decline? | Example (base word)   | Modified form      |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Noun           | ✅ Yes            | puella                | puellae, puellam   |
| Adjective      | ✅ Yes            | magnus                | magna, magnum      |
| Adverb         | ❌ No             | bene (from bonus)     | bene (always)      |

### A few examples

| Adjective | Adverb     | English Meaning         |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------|
| bonus     | bene       | well (from “good”)      |
| magnus    | magnopere  | greatly                 |
| celer     | celeriter  | quickly                 |
| laetus    | laetē      | happily                 |
| liber     | liberē     | freely                  |

### How are adverbs formed?

Latin adverbs have 2 origins:

1. Adjectives (and they can be regular or irregular)
2. No place in particular...

#### First & Second Declension Adjectives

1st & 2nd Declension Adjectives (e.g., clarus, -a, -um), simply add **-ē** to the stem:

| Adjective | Adverb              | Meaning   |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| clarus    | clarē               | clearly   |
| magnus    | magnopere (irreg.)  | greatly   |
| laetus    | laetē               | happily   |
| certus    | certē               | certainly |

#### Third Declension Adjectives

3rd declension adjectives add **-iter** to the stem:

| Adjective | Adverb     | Meaning |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| celer     | celeriter  | quickly |
| fortis    | fortiter   | bravely |
| prudens   | prudenter  | wisely  |

#### Irregular 

There are many other adverbs that are irregular and their link to an adjective (if any) is not clear. These you will have to memorize:

| Adverb    | Meaning                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| *nunc*    | now                             |
| *tum*     | then                            |
| *semper*  | always                          |
| *numquam* | never                           |
| *ubi*     | where                           |
| *hic*     | here                            |
| *cur*     | why                             |
| *bene*    | well (from *bonus*, irregular)  |
| *male*    | badly (from *malus*, irregular) |

Adverbs are typically put _before_ the **verb** they modify; _Puella celeriter currit_. But, Latin being Latin, you have flexibility; and provides different emphasis:

For example:

* _Celeriter, puella currit_
* _Puella currit celeriter_

Each one puts a slightly different emphasis, meaning the same thing.

Some adverbs are tricky, becuase their corresponding adjective _looks 1st or 2nd declension_ but they are irregular. Here are some good examples. Many of these are very common and it is best to memorize them:

| **Adjective**     | **Expected Adverb** | **Actual Adverb**     | **Meaning**              | **Notes**                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| *bonus* (good)    | *bonē*              | **bene**               | well                     | Very common                                   |
| *malus* (bad)     | *malē*              | **male**               | badly                    | Common opposite of *bene*                     |
| *magnus* (great)  | *magnē*             | **magnopere**          | greatly, very much       | Literally “with great effort”                |
| *parvus* (small)  | *parvē*             | **paulum**, **parum**  | a little / too little    | *paulum* = a little; *parum* = not enough     |
| *multus* (much)   | *multē*             | **multum**             | much, a lot              | Common in classical Latin                     |

Latin relies much less than other languages on prepositions, given that the declensions and cases often convey the same meaning. 

But there are still a few prepositions that are important and will commonly appear in all texts. These are used for **emphasis** or **clarity**.

### General Rules

Latin prepositions always govern a case — either the **accusative** or the **ablative**, very rarely the genitive, dative, or vocative.

Prepositions are generally placed **before** the noun they govern. A few can govern either case, but the meaning changes depending on which case is used.

#### Prepositions with the Accusative

Used to express: **motion toward**, **duration**, or **purpose**.

| Latin    | Meaning        | Example               | Translation                     |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| *ad*     | to, toward     | *ad urbem it*         | he goes **to the city**         |
| *per*    | through        | *per silvam ambulat*  | he walks **through the forest** |
| *in*     | into           | *in villam intrat*    | he enters **into the house**    |
| *sub*    | under (motion) | *sub mensam cadit*    | it falls **under the table**    |
| *trans*  | across         | *trans flumen natat*  | he swims **across the river**   |
| *circum* | around         | *circum urbem currit* | he runs **around the city**     |

 #### Prepositions with the Ablative

 Used to express **location**, **means**, **separation**, **cause**, or **accompaniment**.

 | Latin  | Meaning          | Example              | Translation                       |
 | ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
 | *in*   | in, on           | *in villā est*       | he is **in the house**            |
 | *sub*  | under (location) | *sub mensā sedet*    | he sits **under the table**       |
 | *cum*  | with (person)    | *cum amico venit*    | he comes **with a friend**        |
 | *sine* | without          | *sine aquā moritur*  | he dies **without water**         |
 | *de*   | down from/about  | *de monte descendit* | he descends **from the mountain** |
 | *a/ab* | from, by (agent) | *ab urbe venit*      | he comes **from the city**        |
 | *ex/e* | out of, from     | *ex silvā exit*      | he comes **out of the forest**    |

 #### Dual-case Prepositions (Accusative for motion, Ablative for location)

 | Preposition | Accusative Meaning | Ablative Meaning      |
 | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
 | *in*        | into (motion)      | in/on (location)      |
 | *sub*       | under (motion)     | under (location)      |
 | *super*     | over/upon (motion) | over/about (location) |

 One good tip to remember prepositions in Ablative: use the mnemonics **SID SPACE** for: 
 Sine, In, De, Sub, Pro, Ab, Cum, Ex

 As a general rule, if there's movement or direction toward a place use the accusative. If there's location or rest in a place then use the ablative.

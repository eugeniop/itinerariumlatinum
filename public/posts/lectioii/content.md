Second declensions nouns are mostly masculine and neuter. Like first declension nouns, there's a base and endings for each case. Most ,masculine 2nd declensions nouns end in the (familiar) **us**. Many (masculine) names end in **us** too: _Marcus_, _Aurelius_, _Lucius_. Names, like any noun _also_ decline, which I find neat.

Some masculine nouns of the 2nd declension end in **-er** like _ager_, _liber_ and _puer_. 

It is easy to identify 2nd declension nouns because their genitive is always **-ī**.

### Masculine (-us and -er)

|Singular|Noun|Ending|
|--------|------|------|
|Nominative     |amicus / puer / Marcus  | -us / -er |
|Genitive       |amicī / puerī / Marcī | -ī   |
|Dative         |amicō / puerō / Marcō   | -ō   |
|Accusative     |amicum / puerum / Marcum   | -um  |
|Ablative       |amicō / puerō /  Marcō    | -ō   |
|Vocative       |amice / puer / Marce     | -e / -er |

|Plural|Noun|Ending|
|--------|------|------|
|Nominative     |amicī / puerī          | -ī   |
|Genitive       |amicōrum / puerōrum    | -ōrum  |
|Dative         |amicīs / puerīs        | -īs  |
|Accusative     |amicōs / puerōs        | -ōs  |
|Ablative       |amicīs / puerīs        | -īs   |
|Vocative       |amicī / puerī          | -ī  |

Plurals for proper names is not common, unless you are talking to a **group of Marcuses**.

Nouns like _ager_ drop the middle **e** because frankly it sounds weird otherwise. So it becomes:

|Singular|Noun|Ending|
|--------|------|------|
|Nominative     |ager               | -us / -er |
|Genitive       |agri               | -i   |
|Dative         |agro               | -ō   |
|Accusative     |agrum              | -um  |
|Ablative       |agrō               | -ō   |
|Vocative       |ager               | -e / -er |

|Plural|Noun|Ending|
|--------|------|------|
|Nominative     |agrī          | -ī   |
|Genitive       |agrōrum    | -ōrum  |
|Dative         |agrīs | -īs  |
|Accusative     |agrōs | -ōs  |
|Ablative       |agrīs | -īs   |
|Vocative       |agrī  | -ī  |

📌 Note: Some -us nouns are actually feminine (e.g., humus – ground), but this is rare.

By now you should notice that _not all endings identify unequivocally a case_. **-īs** can be Ablative or Dative (Plural), **-ī** can be Nominative or Vocative (Plural), **-ō** can be Ablative or Dative (Singular), **-er** Nominative and Vocative (Singular).

So how do we distinguish the case?: word order and context. Sometimes other words next to the noun help. For example, if we read **_magne puer_** we know it is **vocative** because **magne** is an adjective (big) modifying the noun, and it is a vocative. It reads _"Great boy!"_. Also, the "accepted" correct word order in vocative is _Adjective + Noun_. It is theoretically possible to reverse it and say **_puer magne_**, but rarely used. It just "sounds better" this way. **puer** in Nominative and Vocative are indistiguishable, the adjective saves the day. The Nominative **The Great boy** would be **puer magnus** (or more common in prose, **magnus puer**).

> As mentioned in the introduction, adjectives *agree* with the noun in number, gender and case; but they might belong to different declensions. In **magne puer**, **puer** is 2nd declension, **magnus** is 1st/2nd.

Latin is often referred to as a _"dead language"_. In the sense that people don't normally use it to communicate in everyday conversations. Maybe with the exception of anyone living in the Vatican.

That's (almost) accurate, but the language has give birth of many others: all the Italian, Spanish, French, and Romanian dialects. And it has had a tremendous influence in many others, English among them.

I read somewhere that over 60% of the English vocabulary has a Latin root. It might not be an accurate number, but it's certinaly a lot. Here are a few examples:

| **English** | **Latin Root** | **Latin Meaning**      | **Explanation**                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Transmit**     | *mittere*      | to send                | *Trans-* (across) + *mittere* = to send across  |
| **Aquatic**      | *aqua*         | water                  | Related to water                                |
| **Vision**       | *videre*       | to see                 | Related to sight                                |
| **Dictate**      | *dicere*       | to say, speak          | To say or command something                     |
| **Conduct**      | *ducere*       | to lead                | *Con-* (together) + *ducere* = to lead together |
| **Manual**       | *manus*        | hand                   | Something done by hand                          |
| **Justice**      | *iustitia*     | justice, righteousness | Related to fairness or the law                  |
| **Library**      | *liber*        | book                   | A place of books                                |

So, while finding people casually talking in Latin might be hard to find (unless you are in the Vatican), you will be using Latin even if you don't want to.

## Structure of sentences

The most basic sentence structure is the *SOV*: Subject, Object, Verb. 

* The *Subject* indicates the *doer* of an action.
* The *Verb*, describes the *action* or the *state*.
* The *Object*, is the *receiver* of the action.

| Latin               | English                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Puella librum legit | The girl reads the book |

Notice the contrast with English *SVO*.

Latin doesn't have articles and uses fewer prepositions to indicate function. One cool feature of the language is that even though the typical order is *SOV*, Latin allows you to mix up all the word order without loosing the main meaninig. 

* Librum puella legit
* Legit puella librum
* Legit librum puella
* Puella legit librum

They all mean the same. You can't do this in English. If you write *The book reads the girl*, them meaning is completely different. 

>>> While the meaning remains the same, the order of the words is used to put emphasis on different things. _Librum puella legit_ sounds more the type of sentence you will find in poetry or in a speech.

This is possible, because Latin is an _inflected_ language. Meaninig that the words _ending_ changes based on the function they perform:

In the example, *Librum* is in the *Accusative* case, because it is the object. We know this because of the ending *-um*. If the book was the *Subject*, then it would be *Liber*. Words in Latin change with:

* Gender (3 genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter)
* Number (is it one thing or many. Singular or plural)
* The function they perform in a sentence (called a *case*)

| **Case**       | **Singular** | **Plural** | **Function / Use**                        |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Nominative** | *liber*      | *librī*    | Subject of the sentence                   |
| **Genitive**   | *librī*      | *librōrum* | Possession ("of the book")                |
| **Dative**     | *librō*      | *librīs*   | Indirect object ("to/for the book")       |
| **Accusative** | *librum*     | *librōs*   | Direct object ("the book")                |
| **Ablative**   | *librō*      | *librīs*   | Means or manner ("by/with/from the book") |
| **Vocative**   | *liber*      | *librī*    | Direct address ("Oh book!")                |

Descendents of Latin, like Spanish, have retained some of this, but not all. In Spanish, for comparison:

| **Case (Latin)** | **Latin** (Singular) | **Spanish Equivalent**  | **Function / Use**                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Nominative**   | *liber*              | **el libro**            | Subject → “**The book** is new.”      |
| **Genitive**     | *librī*              | **del libro**           | Possession → “**Of the book**”        |
| **Dative**       | *librō*              | **al libro**            | Indirect object → “To the book”       |
| **Accusative**   | *librum*             | **el libro**            | Direct object → “I read **the book**” |
| **Ablative**     | *librō*              | **con el libro**        | Means/agent → “**With the book**”     |
| **Vocative**     | *liber*              | **Oh libro!**           | Direct address → “O book!”            |

But, in Spanish, *many books* is *libros*. Like English, the ending changes with *number*.

This mechanism of identifying function extends from nouns into pronouns and adjectives. Latin nouns, pronouns and adjectives belong to different families with different patterns of endings. The *patterns* are called *declensions*. *Liber* happens to belong to the 2nd declension.

## Latin Declensions

| **Declension** | **Typical Ending**     | **Example Nouns**                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1st            | -a (feminine)          | *puella* (girl), *rosa*          |
| 2nd            | -us, -um (masc/neut)   | *servus* (slave), *bellum* (war) |
| 3rd            | Various endings        | *rex* (king), *mater* (mother)   |
| 4th            | -us (mostly masculine) | *manus* (hand), *fructus*        |
| 5th            | -ēs (feminine)         | *rēs* (thing), *diēs* (day)      |

Why all this complexity? Here's my own theory: languages evolve along with the communities that use them. Commerce, integration, conquest, practical need, education level, intermingling of different people were among the forces that shaped languages. In modern Spanish, we say *resetear* meaning *to reset*. Which is common in software development communities. Latin itself derives from another ancestral language which was even *more* complex. For example it had 3 *numbers*: single, dual and multiple. Latin retained single and multiple. 

As an example, the *locative* case present in *proto indo european*, disapeared almost completely, except for names of cities, small islands and a handful of words. Latin often uses prepositions + ablative for place (e.g., _in urbe_ = in the city).

| **Latin (Locative)** | **Root Noun**       | **Translation**     |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| *Romae*              | *Roma* (1st)        | in/at Rome          |
| *Athenīs*            | *Athēnae* (pl.)     | in/at Athens        |
| *Carthāgine*         | *Carthāgō* (3rd)    | in/at Carthage      |
| *domī*               | *domus* (home)      | at home             |
| *rūris*              | *rūs* (countryside) | in the countryside  |
| *humi*               | *humus* (ground)    | on the ground       |
| *militiae*           | *militia*           | in military service |

Prepositions and word order convention replaced endings to convey meaninig.

## Agreement

Adjectives and pronouns are say to *agree* with the words they modify following these rules:

An adjective or pronoun must match the noun it describes in:
* Gender (masculine, feminine, neuter)
* Number (singular or plural)
* Case (nominative, accusative, etc.)

However, the endings don't have to look the same, because different declensions may use different endings for the same case/gender/number.

For example:

### 📘 Example 1: Adjective Agreement
* Bonus puer librum legit.*
The good boy reads a book.

| Word    | Role                  | Gender    | Number   | Case       |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **hic** | demonstrative pronoun | masculine | singular | nominative |
| **vir** | noun                  | masculine | singular | nominative |

➡️ Bonus agrees with puer in gender, number, and case.

### 📙 Example 2: Adjective + Different Declension
*Magna rēs accidit.*
A great thing happened.

| Word      | Declension | Case       | Number   | Gender   |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| **magna** | 1st (adj.) | nominative | singular | feminine |
| **rēs**   | 5th (noun) | nominative | singular | feminine |

➡️ Different declensions, but still agree in gender, number, and case.

### 📗 Example 3: Pronoun Agreement
*Hic vir est fortis.*
This man is brave.

| Word    | Role                  | Gender    | Number   | Case       |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **hic** | demonstrative pronoun | masculine | singular | nominative |
| **vir** | noun                  | masculine | singular | nominative |


So, the general rule is:

| **Aspect** | **Must Match?** | **Details**                             |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Gender     | ✅ Yes           | Masc/Fem/Neut must match noun           |
| Number     | ✅ Yes           | Singular/Plural must match              |
| Case       | ✅ Yes           | Must match grammatical role in sentence |
| Declension | ❌ No            | Can differ (e.g., 1st adj + 5th noun)   |

## Verbs

Latin verbs carry lots of information in their endings. They are conjugated by: 

* Person (I, you (sing), he/she, you (pl), they) - The *who?*
* Number (singular / plural) - The *How many?*
* Tense (present, future, etc.) - The *When?*
* Mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative) - Tells us how the action is presented: is it a *fact*, a *command*, a *possibility*, or *a wish*?
* Voice (active or passive) - Used to indicate whether the subject is the *receiver* or the *producer* of the action.

For example:

* amō = I love
* amās = you love
* amābat = he/she was loving
* amātur = he/she is loved (passive voice)

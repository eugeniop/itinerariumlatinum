Years ago, I decided to study Latin. I had many motivations to start, among the main ones:

1. The challenge of a new language, in itself something attractive to me. A Language is a mechanism to *think*, not just communicate.
2. As a history enthusiast, I wanted to be able to read the sources, not the modern interpretations. I wanted to be able to read all the inscriptions in the thousands of monuments and buildings in Europe.
3. The classics. I wanted to be able to read the originals from Julius Ceasar, Seneca, et. al.

I made a lot of progress considering I started with **zero** knowledge. I used [DuoLingo](https://www.duolingo.com/learn), took 1:1 classes, read all of [Familia Romana](https://hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series), and subscribed to [Legentibus](https://legentibus.com). I still continue to do all these things.

I have found all these very useful and fun. I can know understand basic Latin, identify lots of words' origins, and read (or get the gist of) a lot of inscriptions. Interestingly, although not sure it is related, my understanding of Italian has also improved.

I read somewhere that you truly know something when you are able to teach it to others. (Was it Feynman?)

So here's this experiment. This blog will be my attempt to teach Latin to someone (maybe no one). I'll be using the awesome [Wheelock's Latin](http://www.wheelockslatin.com) book as a guideline for the progression. You should definitely buy as this blog is not a replacement for all the information, context and content in it.

> You should also get all the companion books, excercises, etc.

Ready?

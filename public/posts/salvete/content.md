Years ago, I decided to study Latin. I had many reasons, but the main ones were:

1. The challenge of a new language—which I find inherently appealing. A language is a tool for *thinking*, not just communicating.  
2. As a history enthusiast, I wanted to read the original sources, not just modern interpretations. I also wanted to understand the countless inscriptions on monuments and buildings across Europe.  
3. The classics. I wanted to read Julius Caesar, Seneca, *et al.* in their original form.  

I’ve made a lot of progress, especially considering I started with **zero** knowledge. I used [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/learn), took 1:1 classes, read all of [*Familia Romana*](https://hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series), and subscribed to [Legentibus](https://legentibus.com). I still do all of these today.

All of them have been both useful and fun. I can now understand basic Latin, recognize the roots of many words, and read (or at least get the gist of) a lot of inscriptions. Interestingly—though I’m not sure it’s related—my understanding of Italian has also improved.

I once read that you truly understand something only when you can teach it to others. (Feynman, maybe?). There's an old latin phrase too: _discere faciendo_ (_"to learn by doing"_).

So, here’s an experiment. This blog will be my attempt to teach Latin to someone (maybe no one). I’ll use the excellent [*Wheelock’s Latin*](http://www.wheelockslatin.com) as a guide for the progression. You should definitely buy it—this blog is no substitute for the wealth of information, context, and content in that book.

> Tip: you should also get the companion books, exercises, etc.

I will also be using ChatGPT, as it has a wealth of Latin knowledge, can clarify what I don't understand, and generate quizes for me.

Ready?

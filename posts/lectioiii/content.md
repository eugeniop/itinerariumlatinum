Neuter nouns are plenty in the 2nd declension. Their Nominative end in **-um**. Nominative plural for the neuter is **-a** which can be easily confused with the (femenine) First Declension. Watch out!

Here are a few important rules for neuters:

### Neuter Rule #1:

✅ **Nominative** = **Accusative** = **Vocative** (in both singular and plural). This is always true for neuter nouns across _all_ declensions.

|Case       |	Singular |	Plural  |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
|Nominative	| bellum	| bella |
|Accusative	| bellum	| bella |
|Vocative	| bellum	| bella |

You only need to memorize 5 distinct forms instead of 6.

### Ruke #2 Typical Endings:

| Case       | Singular | Plural  |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Nominative | -um      | -a      |
| Genitive   | -ī       | -ōrum   |
| Dative     | -ō       | -īs     |
| Accusative | -um      | -a      |
| Ablative   | -ō       | -īs     |
| Vocative   | -um      | -a      |

📘 Example: bellum (war)

| Case        | Singular | Plural |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Nominative  | bellum   | bella  |
| Genitive    | bellī    | bellōrum |
| Dative      | bellō    | bellīs |
| Accusative  | bellum   | bella  |
| Ablative    | bellō    | bellīs |
| Vocative    | bellum   | bella  |

As usual, adjectives must agree with case, number:

| Case       | Singular              | Plural               |
|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Nominative | bellum magnum        | bella magna         |
| Genitive   | bellī magnī          | bellōrum magnōrum   |
| Dative     | bellō magnō          | bellīs magnīs       |
| Accusative | bellum magnum        | bella magna         |
| Ablative   | bellō magnō          | bellīs magnīs       |
| Vocative   | bellum magnum        | bella magna         |



### 3. Because **Nominative** = **accusative**, word order matters a lot:

For example:

* _Bellum oppidum delet._ means _“The war destroys the town.”_
* _Oppidum bellum delet._ means _“The town destroys the war.”_ (possible, but unlikely)

### 4. Agreement with Adjectives

Make sure adjectives match neuter nouns in gender/number/case as usual.

| Latin phrase      | Translation         |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| bellum magnum     | a great war         |
| verbum novum      | a new word          |
| dona pulchra      | beautiful gifts     |
| bella periculosa  | dangerous wars      |

2nd declension adjectives have **-um** / **-a** endings for neuter.

### 5. Neuter Plural as Collective / Abstract

The neuter plural can sometimes refer to general concepts rather than countable objects:

* bona = “goods” / possessions
* mala = “evils” / troubles
* publica = public affairs (root of republic = _res publica_)

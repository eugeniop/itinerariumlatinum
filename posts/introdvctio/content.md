Latin is often called a _"dead language."_ In the sense that people don’t normally use it for everyday conversations—except maybe in the Vatican.

That’s (mostly) true, but Latin gave birth to many other languages: Italian, Spanish, French, and Romanian, among others. It’s also had a huge influence on others, especially English.

I read somewhere that over 60% of English vocabulary has Latin roots. That number might not be exact, but it’s certainly high. Here are a few examples:

| **English** | **Latin Root** | **Latin Meaning**      | **Explanation**                                 |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Transmit**     | *mittere*      | to send                | *Trans-* (across) + *mittere* = to send across  |
| **Aquatic**      | *aqua*         | water                  | Related to water                                |
| **Vision**       | *videre*       | to see                 | Related to sight                                |
| **Dictate**      | *dicere*       | to say, speak          | To say or command something                     |
| **Conduct**      | *ducere*       | to lead                | *Con-* (together) + *ducere* = to lead together |
| **Manual**       | *manus*        | hand                   | Something done by hand                          |
| **Justice**      | *iustitia*     | justice, righteousness | Related to fairness or the law                  |
| **Library**      | *liber*        | book                   | A place of books                                |

So while you might not hear casual Latin conversations (unless you're in the Vatican), you're using Latin roots every day—often without realizing it. Understanding etymology is both fun and enlightening. It helps you grasp the deeper meaning behind words.

## Structure of Sentences

The most basic sentence structure in Latin is *SOV*: Subject–Object–Verb.

* The *Subject* is the doer.
* The *Verb* is the action.
* The *Object* receives the action.

| Latin               | English                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Puella librum legit | The girl reads the book |

English usually follows *SVO* word order. But Latin doesn't rely on word order as much. Thanks to its endings, you can mix things up without changing the meaning:

* Librum puella legit  
* Legit puella librum  
* Legit librum puella  
* Puella legit librum

All mean: *The girl reads the book.*

In English, swapping word order can completely change the meaning. *The book reads the girl* is not the same at all!

> In Latin, different word orders can be used for emphasis—like in poetry or oratory. *Librum puella legit* sounds more poetic.

This flexibility comes from Latin being an *inflected* language—word endings change based on function. For example, *librum* is in the *accusative* case, meaning it's the object of the action. If it were the subject, it would be *liber*.

Latin word endings change with:

* Gender (masculine, feminine, neuter)
* Number (singular or plural)
* Case (role in the sentence)

There are 6 main Latin cases:

| **Case**       | **Singular** | **Plural** | **Function / Use**                        |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Nominative** | *liber*      | *librī*    | Subject of the sentence                   |
| **Genitive**   | *librī*      | *librōrum* | Possession ("of the book")                |
| **Dative**     | *librō*      | *librīs*   | Indirect object ("to/for the book")       |
| **Accusative** | *librum*     | *librōs*   | Direct object ("the book")                |
| **Ablative**   | *librō*      | *librīs*   | Means or manner ("by/with/from the book") |
| **Vocative**   | *liber*      | *librī*    | Direct address ("Oh book!")               |

Romance languages like Spanish retain some of this structure:

| **Case (Latin)** | **Latin** | **Spanish**        | **Use**                                |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Nominative       | *liber*   | **el libro**       | Subject → “The book is new.”            |
| Genitive         | *librī*   | **del libro**      | Possession → “Of the book”              |
| Dative           | *librō*   | **al libro**       | Indirect object → “To the book”         |
| Accusative       | *librum*  | **el libro**       | Direct object → “I read the book”       |
| Ablative         | *librō*   | **con el libro**   | Means → “With the book”                 |
| Vocative         | *liber*   | **¡Oh libro!**     | Direct address → “O book!”              |

English kept a bit of the genitive: *the book’s title*. the **'s** indicating possesssion.

Latin nouns fall into families called *declensions* — patterns of endings. (a word that comes from the verb _declinare_ which means _to change direction or form_). *Liber* belongs to the *2nd declension* which groups primarily masculine and neuter nouns.

## Latin Declensions

| **Declension** | **Ending**             | **Example Nouns**                |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1st            | -a (feminine)          | *puella*, *rosa*                 |
| 2nd            | -us, -um (masc/neut)   | *servus*, *bellum*               |
| 3rd            | Various endings        | *rex*, *mater*                   |
| 4th            | -us (mostly masculine) | *manus*, *fructus*               |
| 5th            | -ēs (feminine)         | *rēs*, *diēs*                    |

Why all this complexity? Latin wasn't necessarily a **designed** language. It evolved over centuries, and sounds/pronounciations shaped the words and sentences. Liguists and grammarians **reverse engineered** what was already spoken and used into this **paradigms**. Languages evolve with the communities using them —commerce, conquest, education, and interaction shape grammar. Latin itself came from *Proto-Indo-European*, an even more complex ancestor with 8 cases and 3 numbers!

The *locative* case mostly disappeared in Latin, except in a few special words and city names:

| **Latin (Locative)** | **Noun**         | **Meaning**          |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| *Romae*              | *Roma*           | in/at Rome            |
| *Athenīs*            | *Athēnae* (pl.)  | in/at Athens          |
| *Carthāgine*         | *Carthāgō*       | in/at Carthage        |
| *domī*               | *domus*          | at home               |
| *rūris*              | *rūs*            | in the countryside    |
| *humi*               | *humus*          | on the ground         |
| *militiae*           | *militia*        | in military service   |

And they never stop evolving really. I am sure 

## Agreement

Adjectives and pronouns must *agree* with the nouns they describe in:

* Gender
* Number
* Case

They don’t have to look the same (they may belong to different declensions), but they must match in function: if the adjective modifies a masculine subject, then it would use masculine nominative endings.

Adjectives typically go next to the noun they modify (after), but there's flexibility (commonly seen in poetry). The exception are adjectives that describe size or number as well as **demonstratives** (**hic**: this, **ille**: that). If there are multiple nouns with the same function, the adjective's ending would match that of the "closest" noun. 

### 📘 Example 1: Adjective Agreement  
*Bonus puer librum legit.* — The good boy reads a book.

| Word    | Role    | Gender    | Number   | Case       |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Bonus   | Adj     | masculine | singular | nominative |
| Puer    | Noun    | masculine | singular | nominative |

### 📙 Example 2: Different Declension  
*Magna rēs accidit.* — A great thing happened.

| Word    | Declension | Gender    | Number   | Case       |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Magna   | 1st        | feminine  | singular | nominative |
| Rēs     | 5th        | feminine  | singular | nominative |

### 📗 Example 3: Pronoun Agreement  
*Hic vir est fortis.* — This man is brave.

| Word | Role    | Gender    | Number   | Case       |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Hic  | Pronoun | masculine | singular | nominative |
| Vir  | Noun    | masculine | singular | nominative |

✅ Match required:  
| **Aspect** | Must Match? | Note                                    |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Gender     | ✅ Yes       | Masculine/Feminine/Neuter               |
| Number     | ✅ Yes       | Singular/Plural                         |
| Case       | ✅ Yes       | Based on sentence role                  |
| Declension | ❌ No        | Can differ (e.g., 1st adj + 5th noun)   |

## Verbs

Latin verb endings carry a lot of information. They’re conjugated by:

* Person (I, you, he/she, etc.)
* Number (singular/plural)
* Tense (when?)
* Mood (fact, command, possibility)
* Voice (active/passive)

*Person* and *Number* must agree with the subject. 

Examples:

* *amō* = I love  
* *amās* = you love  
* *amābat* = he/she was loving  
* *amātur* = he/she is loved  

### Infinitives

The unconjugated form = *to love*, *to see*, etc.

* *amāre* = to love

### Conjugations

Latin has 4 main conjugation groups, based on the infinitive:

| **Conjugation** | **Ending** | **Example** | **Meaning** |
|----------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1st            | -āre       | *amāre*     | to love     |
| 2nd            | -ēre       | *monēre*    | to warn     |
| 3rd            | -ere       | *regere*    | to rule     |
| 4th            | -īre       | *audīre*    | to hear     |

In dictionaries, Latin verbs are listed with 4 forms:

1. Present: *amō* — I love  
2. Infinitive: *amāre* — to love  
3. Perfect: *amāvī* — I loved  
4. Participle: *amātus* — (having been) loved  

We’ll build on these to form all tenses, voices, and moods in future lessons.
